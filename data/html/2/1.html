	<h3>Same Old, Same Old</h3>
	Fifa, while being a popular franchise, has failed to bring something new to each games from the last few 
	years instead using the influence the franchise name carrys to sell copies of the game and the fact it updates
	the squad list and kits for all the games each year. In spite of this game play stays the same each yet it 
	still manages to be released with bugs and glitches. It would far more benificial if they were to release 
	updates for each new season to update players and kits, allowing them to add more features to the existing 
	rather than making a new one each year.
