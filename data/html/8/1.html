	<h3>Popular For a Reason</h3>
	The now seeming cult classic gme of Among Us first became popular over the initial lock down of the corona 
	virus pandemic despite being released in 2018. It based on a simple concept, there is one team member sabotaging
	everyone else and they have to be voted out, but the simplicity allows for great replayability as each game 
	provides enough variation to keep it interesting as roles switch at random so everyone experiences all
	aspects of the game.
