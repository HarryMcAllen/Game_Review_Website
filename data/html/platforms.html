	<h3>Which Platform is Best?</h3>
	Choosing which platform to play your games as it can be an expensive investment to purchase a console or pc
	so its not a decision you want to be making twice. To pick a platform you will need to ask yourself some 
	questions, firstly, do you want to use keyboard and mouse or controller? if controller which of the two 
	layouts do you prefer? What games do you want to play? Are their any platform exclusives that you cant go
	without? What is you budget? Its fair to say a PC can run games better than either console, but to build a PC
	that powerful can often mean spending alot more money on a PC then you would've on a console. The final 
	and most important question to ask is, what do your friends play? Since gaming is all about having fun and
	you will have the most fun with friends, the best idea is to get the same platform as your friends so you 
	have the most fun.
